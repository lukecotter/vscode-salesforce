# Change Log

All notable changes to the "salesforce-snippets" extension will be documented in this file.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-05-29

### Removed

- Snippets already in salesforce extension pack (if, else, while, do while).

### Changed

- For some snippets the final tab will leave the cursor at the end of a new line instead of adding a new line. This prevents the new line needing to be removed when not needed. (newobj, sobjecttype, sobjectfield, describefieldresult, mapids).

## [0.1.0] - 2020-05-28

### Added

- Apex Snippets.
